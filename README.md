A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System

*** The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine
because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors.
They can be divided into three main steps: preprocessing step, feature extraction and selection step, and classification and verification step. 
Handwritten digit recognition problem can be seen as a subtask of the optical character recognition (OCR) problem.
This approach has many advantages: 1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters
which can yield information such as the writing style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation
Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as handwritten text recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten
input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices.***
